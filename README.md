This is where your group will put your project, the Next Big Thing
in apps!

## How to Submit

Your project will be a series of commits, starting with a project proposal.
This proposal can be in markdown, plain text, or PDF, and should have an
obvious name. In addition, you should include an Xcode project, as with the
solo projects.

We will discuss your proposal with you, so that it is appropriately scoped
for difficulty (not too easy, nor too hard), and has clearly-identified
milestones, minimal goals, and stretch goals. There will be three milestone
submissions before the final submission.

## Format of the Proposal

Your proposal should have the following format:

 * Project title
 * List of team members
 * General description of the app
 * Minimal Goals -- these are things your app *must* do
 * Stretch Goals -- these are additional functionality that might earn extra points
 * Project timeline, including development milestones
