This is where your group will put your project, the Next Big Thing
in apps!

## General Requirements

You must implement the project in Swift, using SwiftUI for the View.
You *may not* use external libraries or frameworks without prior
approval. Firebase is an approved framework. If you wish to use
functionality from UIKit or other built-in frameworks, you may, but
the bulk of your interface must still be in SwiftUI. When in doubt,
ask.

Your project must go beyond the topics we covered in class in some
significant way, and must somehow take advantage of features of a
mobile device (mobility, camera, motion sensors, etc.).

## How to Submit

Your project will be a series of commits, starting with a project proposal.
This proposal can be in markdown, plain text, or PDF, and should have an
obvious name. In addition, you should include an Xcode project, as with the
solo projects.

We will discuss your proposal with you, so that it is appropriately scoped
for difficulty (not too easy, nor too hard), and has clearly-identified
milestones, minimal goals, and stretch goals. There will be three milestone
submissions before the final submission.

The final submission must include the following:

 * an Xcode project that builds and runs on the iPhone 12 simulator
 * a 5-10 page (roughtly 2500 to 5000 words) report describing not just your
   app, but your design process, and how your ideas evolved over the course
   of the project
 * a 5 minute screen recording of your app, including audio description; several
   apps will be selected for in-class demonstration based on these

## Format of the Proposal

Your proposal should have the following format:

 * Project title
 * List of team members
 * General description of the app
 * Minimal Goals -- these are things your app *must* do
 * Stretch Goals -- these are additional functionality that might earn extra points
 * Project timeline, including development milestones

We have provided a sample proposal on ELMS that corresponds to the in-class
exercises. Your proposal will obviously have to include functionality beyond
what we will do for these exercises.
